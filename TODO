Roadmap for AWESOME TOWER DEFENSE:

0.3:
    *   Hotkeys
    *   New sprites for some of the towers.
    *   Different looks for the different kind of projectiles
    *   Put graphics inside the binary, to fix distribution issues.
    *   Fix icons and such.
    *   Fix documentation.
    *   Fix an ingame tutorial.

0.4:
    *   Draw a circle which indicates the range of the tower when selected, 
        and when you want to buy one.
    *   Code cleanups.
    *   New enemy sprites.

0.5:
    *   Implement local highscores.
            -   For linux, I'll implement the /var/games/ correctly.
    *   Add all sorts of statistics about the game.

0.6:
    *   Implement online highscore.
